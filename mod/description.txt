Enter a new world, entirely seperate from what the base game has to offer, in New Terra. This massive expansion mod includes XXX+ new rooms spread over 6* new regions, complete with a brand new slugcat and multiple exciting new features!

*not counting the 9-room tutorial region

Huge thanks to everyone who helped out with this mod, including:
M4rbleL1ne, who added the Mini Fruit Branch to his entity pack at my request, along with all the other amazingly designed, publicly available creatures and items in the pack,
Millisec, for the ambient track,
tarigon_tetradactyl and Detrax, for some of the charming decals included in this mod,
Sol/prismsoup, for the stunning region artwork (One),
aprilWORSTmonth and Ovidia/gogurtyuri for arenas (not really),
and everybody who joined the development server, as well as everyone in Modhole who supported and encouraged me!

No thanks, but rather an acknowledgement for hootis, who coded lots of useful (and necessary) features for the mod. Sucks in hindsight.
